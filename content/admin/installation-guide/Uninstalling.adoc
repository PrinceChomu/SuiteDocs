== Uninstalling a SuiteCRM instance

Follow these steps to uninstall your SuiteCRM instance:

1.  Navigate to the directory within your web server where SuiteCRM is
located.
2.  Remove the SuiteCRM directory(Linux: rm -r <suitedirectory> if you
wish to be prompted, rm -rf <suitedirectory> if you wish to delete the
directory without being prompted).
3.  Delete the SuiteCRM database schema from your server
database(default is “suitecrm”, this will differ if this has been
renamed during the installation process)..
