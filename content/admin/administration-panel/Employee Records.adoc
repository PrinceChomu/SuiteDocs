= List of Employees

As the System Administrator, you can manage the list of employees of the organization, as well as add new entries to the specified list.

When a new employee is added to the list, he also appears in the list of system users, but without a password set, thus the newly added employee is not a SuiteCRM user and cannot work with the application until he is granted the appropriate access rights to the system.
