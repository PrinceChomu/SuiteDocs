title: Creating a Custom SearchEngine
---

:imagesdir: /images/en/developer/SearchFramework

{{% notice info %}}
This enhancement is only available in SuiteCRM from version 7.11 onwards.
{{% /notice %}}

At the core of the SearchFramework there is the customisable nature of the SearchEngine class.
In order to make a SearchEngine sub-class that will be detected by the `SearchWrapper`
all you need to do is create a file in the `custom/Extension/SearchEngines` folder that
extends the SearchEngine class and implements the `search(SearchQuery $query)` method.

== Mock search example

The example below shows a search engine that, regardless of your search query, will return the Administrator.

[source,php]
----
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchEngine;
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchQuery;
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchResults;

class FakeSearch extends SearchEngine
{
    public function search(SearchQuery $query)
    {
        return new SearchResults([
            'Users' => [1]
        ]);
    }
}

== City search example

The example above is perfectly valid and would work, but it's rather useless. Let's try making a simple SearchEngine
that searches for Accounts that have the address in a given town.

[source,php]
----
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchEngine;
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchQuery;
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchResults;

class CitySearch extends SearchEngine
{
    public function search(SearchQuery $query)
    {
        $sql = "SELECT id FROM accounts WHERE billing_address_city = '%s' OR shipping_address_city = '%s' LIMIT %d OFFSET %d";

        // Format the query with the values
        $sql = sprintf(
            $sql, // SQL Query above
            $query->getSearchString(), // First equals
            $query->getSearchString(), // Second equals
            $query->getSize(), // LIMIT
            $query->getFrom() // OFFSET
        );

        // Get an instance of the dabatabase manager
        $db = DBManagerFactory::getInstance();
        // Perform the query
        $rows = $db->query($sql);
        // Initialize an array with the results
        $results = ['Accounts' => []];

        // Fetch the row and push the id in the results array
        while ($row = $db->fetchRow($rows)) {
            $results['Accounts'][] = $row['id'];
        }

        // Make a new SearchResults object with the results array and return
        return new SearchResults($results);
    }
}
----

== Customising view example

It is possible to customise how the search engine builds the interface by overriding the
`displayForm()` and `displayResults()` methods. If you need a higher degree of control,
you can override the `searchAndDisplay()` method entirely.

By default, `displayForm()` (displaying the search bar) and `displayResults()`
(displaying results and errors) call `SearchFormController` and `SearchResultsController`
respectively to create the views. These two classes are intended to be used and customised by custom search engines.

In the example below we will override the `displayResults()` method for the class above, and tell
the engine to load a different template file. The template file is a custom one placed in the same
folder as the engine, and it will show a table view with three columns: bean name, shipping address and billing address.
The said smarty template file can be found just after the code for the class.

[source,php]
----
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchEngine;
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchQuery;
use SuiteCRM\Search\SearchResults;
use SuiteCRM\Search\UI\SearchResultsController;

class CitySearchWithView extends SearchEngine
{
    public function search(SearchQuery $query) { // Same as example above. }

    public function displayResults(SearchQuery $query, SearchResults $results)
    {
        // Override the displayResults() method to change how the `SearchWrapper` will show the results.

        // I have used an anonymous class just for simplicity in the example.
        // The extended controller can be normally placed in a separate file.
        $controller = new class($query, $results) extends SearchResultsController
        {
            public function __construct(SearchQuery $query, SearchResults $results)
            {
                parent::__construct($query, $results);
                // Let us load a custom template file.
                $this->view->setTemplateFile(__DIR__ . '/citysearch.tpl');
            }
        };

        // Finally ask the Controller to render the view.
        $controller->display();
    }
}

== Throwing errors
You can safely throw exceptions at any point while writing your own SearchEngine. Errors will be caught
by the `SearchThrowableHandler` class and a friendly message will be shown to the user.

If your SuiteCRM instance is in developer mode a detailed exception page will be shown, making it easier for you to
debug.

In the example below the same erroneous query is shown with `developer mode` on (left) and off (right). image:ErrorPage.png[asd]

If you wish to directly show an error message to the user, you can throw a `SearchUserFriendlyException`. Remember to
use the translation framework if you want the error to be localised, and never show details that are (too) technical.

Example of throwing a user-friendly error message:
[source, php]
throw new SearchUserFriendlyException(translate('LBL_ERROR_MESSAGE_INVALID_QUERY'));

== Conclusions

To learn more about the Search Framework, do not be afraid to look at the code in `lib\Search`.
It is intended to be simple, readable and well-documented.
