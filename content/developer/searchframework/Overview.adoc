{{% notice info %}}
This enhancement is only available in SuiteCRM from version 7.11 onwards.
{{% /notice %}}

The Search Framework aims to make the creation of search engines for SuiteCRM as easy as possible,
with a minimal impact on the user experience, allowing reuse of UI elements.

Its components live in the `lib\Search`. An overview of the file structure will follow:

== Main Classes

=== SearchWrapper
The main class of the Search Framework that allows to easily perform searches using static methods.

=== SearchEngine
Abstract class that contains utilities for classes implementing it.
The built-in methods take care of showing the results and the search view, and can be overridden if necessary.
Subclasses are only required to implement the `search(SearchQuery $query)` method, although it is recommended
override the `validateQuery(SearchQuery $query)` method too.

=== SearchQuery
The SearchQuery object wraps all the parameters used by the SearchWrapper and SearchEngine.

It has a set of factory methods to populate the parameters in a standard manner.

It contains the following fields (available via getters):

- `$query` ─ A string containing the search query. When empty no search will be performed.
- `$size` ─ An int specifying how many results are requested. Defaults to 10.
- `$from` ─ An int used for pagination, effectively an offset. Defaults to 0.
- `$engine` ─ A string containing the name of the SearchEngine class to use. Defaults according to the configuration.
- `$options` ─ An array containing options that might be needed by custom SearchEngines.

=== SearchResults
The SearchResults class holds the results of a search, along with metadata such as the search time, total number of hits
and the score of the results.

It contains the following fields (available via getters):

- `$hits` ─ An array containing the search results. Results are nested by module.
- `$scores` ─ An array with indexes matching those of `$hits` containing a float specifying the results.
- `$options` ─ An array containing custom options to be used by engines.
- `$searchTime` ─ A float with the amount of seconds it took to perform the search.
- `$total` ─ An int with the total number of hits (without pagination).
- `$groupedByModule` ─ Flag specifying if the `$hits` array is grouped by module.

== Communication Diagram
The diagram below illustrates how the search process works, when a user performs a search.

The `Search` class is located in `modules/Home/`, and is effectively the controller that handles the browser request.
